## What will you do?

Show off your newly acquired knowledge of Machine Learning.
The entire class will work together to complete an interesting
machine learning project:  A facial emotion recognition system.
The project will be presented and demonstrated on a laptop on
the last day of class. Please plan ahead and work towards this
deadline.

## What are the guidelines?

- The project must feature classifiers specifically designed/
trained by the class. Downloaded programs are not acceptable.
Simple classifiers are perfectly acceptable, especially if
they effectively illustrate topics covered in the assignments.
Some exceptions can be made if certain classifiers are too
complex to be implemented from scratch within the available
time. An example would be the face detection component of the
system i.e. you are allowed to borrow code found on the
Internet, and use it to extract the face from a picture. Your
code will take the face as input and recognize the emotion
present.
- The system must be able to recognize a minimum of 3 emotions:
Happy, Sad, and Neutral. A stretch goal is to be able to
additionally recognize Surprise, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and
Contempt. A second stretch goal is to adapt the system to
count the number of fingers held up on a hand positioned in
front of the camera.
- To the extent possible, you are required to explain how the
system works to recognize emotions. You are discouraged from
appealing to a black-box algorithm whose workings are a
complete mystery.
- The training data must be created by the class, with each
student contributing facial images on a completely voluntary
basis. Opting out of this contribution to training data is
allowed, but full participation of the class is encouraged.
- Be prepared to have visitors show up for the presentation to
test the system. You can really impress the audience (and be
extra proud of your accomplishments) by working towards a
real-time demonstration.
- Annotated code and a PowerPoint presentation describing the
project are required. You are welcome to take turns presenting
the project. Communicate the insights you got from your project.
This is important! Please include the following:
  - What did you enjoy about this project?
  - What, if anything, took you by surprise?
  - What did you learn as a result of this? What was insightful?
  - Could you have done this project without attending this class?
